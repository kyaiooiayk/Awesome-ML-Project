Learn it by doing it - LIBDI

## Lesson learnt
- Don't assume the data is available.
- Don't assume the data is easy to get.
- Don't fail to start over and reassess when I realized the project was going in weird directions.
- Don't fail to connect model's objective and the way the model might be used.
- Don't fail to appreciate the core of the problem could effectively be predicting something way bigger and more complex.
